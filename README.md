# Whats working
```
compiling and executing implemented functions
data section(instructions still cant use it now)
```
# Implemented instructions
```
(Byte variants are  included)
MOV(working on registers,and variables)
ADD(needs more testing)
SUB(needs more testing)
MUL(untested)
JMP(fully working)
```
# Easily implementable instructions
```
math operations
BOOLEAN basic operations
```
# Harder to implement
```
STACK operations
BX,SI,DI pointer operations
SYSCALLS
fuctions/procedures
```
# How to use
```
download source zip snd unzip
run interprete8088.py
chose your file with the "compile" button
run instructions using "next" button
a "test.s" file is included in the zip
```
# Why the project stopped?
Because it started with the goal to have something ready easy to use for an exam,the other project taken over this one,since it was more faster and easier to implement.
