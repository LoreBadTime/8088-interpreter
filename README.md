# 8088-interpreter
python 8088 interpreter

# THE PROJECT IS UNCOMPLETED

the main idea was to convert 8088 Assembly language into python functons and run the code into a tiny interpreter

# whats working
nothing since 8088 instructions needs to be compiled

# implemented instructions
```
MOV(Byte instuctions are included in MOV since the interpreter can recognise registers)
ADD
SUB
GOTO/JMP
```
# Easily implementable instructions
```
MUL
DIV
BOOLEAN basic operations
```
# Harder to implement
```
PUSH 
POP
BX,SI,DI pointer operations
SYSCALLS
```
# Why the project stopped?
Because it started with the goal to have something ready easy to use for an exam,the other project taken over this one,since it was more faster and easier to implement.
